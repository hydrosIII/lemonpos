LemonPOS is an open source Point of Sale software targeted for micro, small and medium businesses.
MySQL is employed for data management and storage, and can be used a single database with
many POS terminals on a network.
Being Linux or any other unix the target operating system, your information is safer against
virus attacks, and lowers the costs in licenses.

Lemon provides a modern themeable and easy to use Interface, a search panel, a price-checker tool,
an administration tool for managing your store, printed reports, and more...

It has beeen tested with a parallel matrix printer (Star Micronics SP500), an USB thermal printer
(Star Micronics TSP143), and an USB barcode reader (Dataogic DLC6065-M0).


I have tested also with EPSON TMT printers.

It will work with full capacity if the ticket printer has a cups driver, 
if not you can also print to pure text, but features like paper cutting 
will not work properly unless configured.

I'm rebuilding the original project from Miguel Chavéz. Im not a 
programmer but i will provide documentation for this program.

Current branch master is taken from FacturaMX branch in Miguel's repo. 
It is the source code for 30-abr-2013 lemon release present at 
sourceforge, and so my starting point.


For the nest months (writing in nomvember 2014) i will:

--- Provide better translations to spanish, and possibly portuguese.
--- Add some documentation to install the package and give some advanced options.
--- Create packages for new distributions focusing in Debian and Arch linux.
--- Some code cleaning.
